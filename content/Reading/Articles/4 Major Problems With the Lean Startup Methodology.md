## My Highlights
> While we were working on Anywhere.FM, we came across another small music startup founded by Daniel Ek in Sweden. We didn&#39;t think much of the startup at the time because its team had spent two years just building a product before ever launching it. 
> Given the company’s slow pace of innovation, which contradicted the core principles of Lean, we assumed they wouldn&#39;t amount to much. 
> But as we know, Daniel Ek&#39;s “little” startup called Spotify went on to revolutionize the entire music industry and popularize the music streaming paradigm we all take for granted today.
\- 

> Peter Thiel, who co-founded Founders Fund and PayPal, shared an early critique of the Lean Startup in his book Zero to One. He offers the following perspective on the Lean approach of encouraging endless experimentation in order to stumble upon something that customers like:
> “Why should you expect your own business to success without a plan? Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best.”
\- 

> Andy Rachleff, Co-founder of Wealthfront and Benchmark Capital, takes this even further by describing why this approach is insufficient:
> “You cannot customer-development your way into a massive success. Non-consensus, outlier wins come when you start with a unique insight.”
\- 

> Validating the riskiest assumptions in your product strategy. This will help you pick the most appropriate validation techniques given your riskiest assumption, moving beyond the simplistic view of MVPs. We’ll then show you how to update your PMF Narrative based on what you’ve learned in order to continue refining and improving your product strategy.
\- 

> Quantitatively measuring PMF through a concrete set of metrics and using those to determine the most appropriate next steps. We’ll give you the tools to precisely determine where you are on your PMF journey and what the next best action is for getting closer to it.
\- 

> Developing traction while simultaneously iterating throughout the PMF loop. We’ll guide you through determining both your initial traction channels as well as your long-term sustainable growth loop, ensuring that growth is baked into your strategy from day one.
