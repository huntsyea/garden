## My Highlights
> Lumbar stabilization is the natural ability of the spinal column to maintain its anatomical structure on physiological loading. The stability is maintained by the interaction between the bony structure with ligaments, the attached muscles, and the nervous system that connects the above two. Natural disc degeneration combined with sedentary behavior can lead to weakness of the muscles, which can then cause segmental instability.

> In a normal healthy spine, the above three systems interact and allow normal function and a pain-free range of movement. With stress loading of the passive system (vertebrae, disc, ligaments, and joints), the active system (muscles) come into play and prevent abnormal deformation

> An inability of the active system to maintain the relationship between different elements of the passive system during physiological loading can lead to spinal pain. Based on this, clinical instability can be defined as the abnormal displacement that occurs within the motion segment when a normal physiological load is applied.[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#)

> Muscles provide stability in the neutral zone. Both strength and endurance are equally important. These factors contribute to endurance to maintain stability over long periods of static postures and increased strength when the spine is subject to suddenly increased stress like a fall or a sudden loading of the spine: both muscular strength and endurance decrease in patients with low back pain

> Maintaining the spine in the neutral zone is important to prevent injury. In the elastic zone or at extremes of motion, there is likely a chance of injury when the spine is loaded

> Even when the powerlifters were in global full flexion, the individual lumbar segments were not in full flexion and remained in the neutral zone to protect the spine

> The mainstay of treatment in chronic low back pain is exercise and retraining to improve the strength and endurance of the muscles to provide stability during trunkal perturbations. Also, it is crucial to facilitate the proper and sequential firing of muscles.

> The core is a box structure made up of the abdominal muscles in the front and the sides, the paraspinal and gluteal muscles at the back, the diaphragm at the roof, and the pelvic floor and the hip girdle muscles as the floor.[[12|12]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#) The abdominal muscles create a rigid cylinder around the spine during movement and provide stability.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn58eweckdzyp60hk7bxets2))

> The pelvic floor muscles also form part of the core.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn58f7h66pg6m8enah7fmbx3))

> The muscles in the back of the core or that which envelope the vertebrae can be subdivided into the deeper uni-segmental muscles, i.e., the multifidus and the superficial large multisegmental muscles i.e., the erector spinae.[[16|16]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#) The larger multisegmental muscles like the erector spinae are involved in lifting, and the oblique abdominal muscles are involved in rotational movements of the spine.[[17|17]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#)
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn58fr0khghar8rrendvqgag))

> These larger muscles do not have a direct attachment to the spinal segment and hence are unable to stabilize the individual segments. The multifidus, which is deeper, has direct attachments to the spinal segments, and allows stabilization of the motion segment during lifting and rotational movements of the spine.[[9|9]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#) The deeper uni segment muscles being close to the axis of the spine act as force transducers
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn58gmxmaa1fp7g4pyraf3eb))

> When there is a delay in the contraction of the multifidus, the larger and global superficial muscles like the erector spinae contract to compensate for the delay in increasing the stiffness of the lumbar spine. Unfortunately, the activation of the large global muscles creates abnormal forces across the individual segments resulting in back pain.[[20|20]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#) This situation is why patients say that any movement causes spasmodic pain
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn58j74a1a2e33hvhd14s03m))

> Rehabilitation involves correcting this delayed activation of the deep muscles. If therapy only involves strengthening the muscles without correction of the delay, then it can result in recurrence and chronicity
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn58jjg94wfsh0anj7jtn86y))

> Unfortunately, the standard spinal examination taught in medical schools does not include any clinical test to identify the weakness of the muscle, which could cause segmental instability. A physician's report to a patient with mechanical low back pain, at the end of a standard clinical examination, is that no abnormal pathology has been identified. This both frustrates the patient and also does not provide the answers required to help the patient.

> The standard examination involves documenting the range of movement. The quantitative range of movement may not be as significant as the qualitative range of movement. The important feature of spinal instability is the aberrant motion that occurs when flexing and extending the spine. A catch, a painful arc, supporting the arms on the thighs, or a reversal of the lumbopelvic rhythm when standing from the flexed posture indicates instability.
> The subject lies on the examination couch. The examiner passively lifts the lower limbs to a height of 30 cm from the coach while maintaining the knee in extension and applying gentle traction on the legs. A positive test is recorded if the patient complains of "pain in the lower back region" or complains of "heaviness in the lower back" or complains that, "the lower back is coming off." These experiences should return to normal when the leg returned to the couch. The passive lumbar extension test has the highest combined sensitivity and specificity and may be comparable to radiological findings to identify lumbosacral structural instability.
> The patient stands at the foot end of the examination couch. The patient then lowers his/her upper body to rest on the examination couch. The iliac crest should rest on the edge of the examination couch. The patient holds the sides of the examination couch for increased stability. In the first part of the test, the feet of the patient is resting on the ground. The examiner with the heel of his/her hand creates a small posterior to anterior trust at each segment of the lumbar spine. Pain, if experienced by the patient, is recorded. In the second part of the test, the patient is asked to lift the feet of the floor and steady himself /herself by holding onto the sides of the examination couch. The examiner again repeats the posterior to anterior trust with the heel of his/her hand at each lumbar segment. The test is positive if the pain created in the initial part of the test subsides when the extensor muscles of the spine are tensed by lifting the feet of the floor.

> The legs of the patient are strapped onto a low platform, which is only 25 cms above the floor. The upper end of the iliac crest is aligned to the edge of the table. The upper torso rests on the floor. At the commencement of the test, the patient extends the spine and lifts the upper torso off the floor with the arms crossed across the chest and is asked to maintain the horizontal position. The record of the time, the patient can maintain this position is documented. Normative values: Men 146 +/- 51. Women 189 +/- 60.
> The patient lies prone on the examination couch with a pad underneath the abdomen and the arms along the sides. The patient is instructed to lift the upper trunk about 30 degrees from the table while keeping the neck flexed, and the intention is to hold the sternum of the surface of the couch. The clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 40 +/- 9. Women 52 +/- 18.[[30|30]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#)
> The patient lies prone on the examination couch with the hips extended and the hands underneath the forehead. The arms are perpendicular to the body. The patient is then requested to lift both the legs off the couch until the knee is cleared off the couch. The patient should maintain normal breathing during the entire test procedure. The examiner can monitor the knee clearance by sliding a hand under the knee. The clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 38 +/- 6. Women 35 +/- 5. The prone double straight leg raise has shown to have great sensitivity and specificity.
> The patient lies supine on the couch with the legs extended. The hands are placed on the temples with the elbows pointing to the ceiling. The patient is then instructed to lift the head, the arms and upper trunk of the couch. The patient should maintain normal breathing during the entire test procedure. The clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 43 +/- 9. Women 32 +/- 5.
> The patient lies supine with the legs extended, and the arms crossed in front of the chest. The pelvis is tilted forward to increase the lumbar lordosis. The patient is then requested to lift both the legs of the floor for 30 degrees while maintaining normal breathing during the entire test procedure. To monitor the pelvic tilt, the examiner can place one hand under the lumbar spine. The clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 28 +/- 4. Women 28 +/- 4.
> The patient is supine on the couch with the upper part of the body propped up on a support. The support is at an angle of 60 degrees. The legs are flexed so that the knee is at a 90-degree angle with the foot flat on the couch. The toes and feet are strapped to the couch to provide a counterbalance. In a modified procedure, the examiner sits on the edge of the couch and over the toes of the patient to provide a counterbalance. The arms are crossed across the chest towards the opposite shoulder. The support is moved back by 10 cms, and the patient is instructed to maintain the original position. The clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normal values: Men 144 +/- 76, Women 149 +/- 99 in normal subjects.
> The patient lies prone on a mat. Initially, the patient lifts his / her upper torso off the mat and steadies on the elbows and forearms. The elbow is directly below the shoulder, and the forearms are straight with hands in front of the elbow. The patient then lifts the pelvis off the mat. The body is now supported on the elbow/forearm and the tips of the toes. The patient maintains a rigid horizontal position parallel to the floor. The clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 124 +/- 72s, Women 83 +/- 63s.
> The patient lies supine with the legs flexed so that the knee is at a 90-degree angle, and the foot is flat on the couch but not touching each other. The elbows are bent, and the hands are placed on the ears. The patient then lifts the pelvis so that the shoulders, hips, and knees are in a straight line. A rigid position is maintained, and the clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 188 +/- 45s, Women 152 +/- 30s.
> The patient lies on the side on a mat. The upper part of the body is lifted off the mat and supported on the elbow of the arm below. The opposite (upper) arm crosses across the chest onto the lower shoulder. The top foot is positioned in front of the lower foot. The patient is then instructed to lift the pelvis off the floor and to maintain the trunk and the legs in a straight line. A rigid position is maintained, and the clinician records the maximum time that the patient can hold this position. Normative values: Men 95 +/- 35s, Women 74 +/- 33s.

> Exercises have become the cornerstone of treating and preventing back pain. Evidence suggests that the lack of muscle strength can itself contribute to low back pain even in the absence of degeneration. A study of adolescents aged between 14 to 16 and who had minimal to no degenerative changes showed that weakness of the lumbar spine extension was a risk factor for developing low back pain

> deep fibers of the multifidus are the first to become active when a limb is moved because a limb can only move on a stable axial skeleton. Hence co-activation of the spinal and abdominal muscles is required before limb movement or any activity that involves perturbation of the trunk and spine

> The dysfunction of the multifidus muscle results in delay and reduced activity. When there is a delay or reduced activity in the deeper multifidus, the larger multi-segmental muscles compensate by co-activation. Motor control errors or lack of the abdominals and the multifidus acting before larger global muscles increase compressive forces across spinal segments and result in pain

> Motor control exercises involve retraining the deep local muscle system i.e., the multifidus and the transverse abdominis, to become active before the larger global multisegment muscles become active.

> The Motor control exercise (MCE) program involves three stages.[[44|44]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562179/#) In the first stage, the local stabilizing muscles (i.e., the lumbar multifidus and the transversus abdominis) are activated by an abdominal drawing-in maneuver (ADIM) while maintaining normal breathing. The abdominal drawing-in maneuver is maintained for 8 seconds. The ADIM is performed in 4 different body positions, sitting, standing, supine lying, and quadruped positions.

> The target to aim for is 30 repetitions in each position. After reaching the goal by the second week, then the second stage of the program starts.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gn59h6bqvjtk8hzy8rej9zem))

> In the second stage, increased loads are placed on the trunk by placing the upper and lower limbs and the trunk in various positions while continuing with the ADIM. This activity may involve heel slide in supine, curls in supine, side bridge with knees bent, the side bridge with knees straight, prone plank, supine bridge, a quadruped with raised contralateral arm and leg. The second stage continues from the second week to the fourth week. From the fifth week, the patient can progress to the third stage of the program; this involves using functional positions like rolling, sit to stand transfer, squatting, and sit to stand transfer. Rabin et al. provide a detailed description of images.
