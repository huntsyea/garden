## My Highlights
> Build something you want i.e. solve your own problem * The next best thing to an unmet need of your own is an unmet need of someone else. * Live in the future, then build what's missing. * Turn off your “unsexy problems” filter. * Turn off your “schlep” filter i.e. your filter for tasks that are tedious or unpleasant. * Ask yourself whether in your previous job you ever found yourself saying "Why doesn't someone make x? If someone made x we'd buy it in a second.”

> Go through every job you ever had: * What are the unique skills you learned? * What seemed broken? * What did you develop in-house? * Look for things that have changed in the world recently e.g. new technological changes, new regulations, new problems in the world. * Brainstorm with friends.

> Unbundling larger platforms (example) * Senior managers tend to be a good source of knowing what their problems are and what’s holding back their performance * Trawl through the last YC Startup Directory list and figure out what might fit your particular favourite domain, with some modification * Audience: Brainstorm personas you identify with or wish to help, then I look at market research to find the obstacles they face.
