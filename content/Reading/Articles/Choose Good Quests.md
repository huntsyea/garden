## My Highlights
> Combustion, penicillin, nuclear fission; the discovery of America, the drafting of the Constitution, Normandy — history is defined by protagonists pursuing good quests.
\- 

> Silicon Valley's best — our top operators, exited founders, and most powerful investors — are almost all on bad quests.
\- 

> Exiting your first startup only to enter venture capital and fight your peers for allocation in a hot deal is a bad quest.
\- 

> Yachting between emails in de facto retirement at age 35 is a very bad quest.
\- 

> There are important challenges facing humanity that no one is working on, including critical, and even existential challenges.
\- 

> failure to pursue a good quest is not neutral. It constitutes a loss for humanity.
\- 

> A hard quest is high-risk and operationally complex, with a low chance of success.
\- 

> An easy quest is typically more straightforward, with a well-understood playbook for success.
\- 

> There are certainly bad quests that are hard, and (a few) good quests that are easy. But most of the remaining good quests are difficult to make profitable, require heavy research and development spend, or are just incredibly technically challenging, to the point of near impossibility.
\- 

> A player's ability to complete their quest is a function of the quest and their own skills, resources, and powers. Quests that are easy for certain players are nearly impossible for others: Olympic runners will regularly run sub-5 minute miles during training, even though this would be an incredibly ambitious goal for most people.
\- 

> if a talented nuclear physicist with compelling insights into the field, ample resources, and many well-connected peers decides to open a tiki bar in Bali that is an extraordinarily bad quest.
\- 

> In the 1980s, a venture capitalist could truthfully say their investment was the difference between life or death for an important, generational technology company.
\- 

> today there are more people "helping the builders" than actually building, fighting one another in a zero-sum game for allocation in competitive deals.
\- 

> many former founders leverage their success to become public pseudo-intellectuals, speaking on podcasts and broadcasting their thoughts on popular tech Twitter accounts. But unless you are a truly generational thinker, proselytizing is far less impactful than building a specific,
\- 

> many self-titled public intellectuals are not even particularly intellectual. They are just… public.
\- 

> Today, the market is overrun with luxury credit cards and task management tools.
\- 

> players may profit from winning market share from existing companies, they've allocated talent (including their own) and resources away from hard, important problems.
\- 

> The question of the day was what they would do with all of their newfound social capital and leverage. Would this be a sequel to the Valley’s legendary PayPal Mafia, in which the founding team of a paradigm-altering technology company continued on to found and fund an entire generation of paradigm-altering technology companies?
\- 

> It would not.
\- 

> Today, even the name “Facebook Mafia,” once in vogue for all of its potential, has nearly been forgotten.
\- 

> For our best players with exceptional fundraising and hiring superpowers, hard quests are difficult. But for everyone else, they are nearly impossible. Therefore, there is a moral imperative for our best players to choose good, hard quests.
\- 

> The quintessential example of successful founders using their social capital for good are the billionaire space cowboys — Musk, Branson, and Bezos.
\- 

> Less discussed examples include Sam Altman taking over OpenAI, where he and his team have delivered mind-bending AI products like GPT-3 and DALL-E,
\- 

> Palmer Luckey used his earnings from selling Oculus to Facebook to launch Anduril, a new-age defense prime building innovative technology for national security.
\- 

> Peter Reinhard exited from Segment, his (admittedly somewhat boring) enterprise software company, he founded Charm Industrial, a complex carbon removal tech company.
\- 

> Jeff Kaditz left his fintech startup Affirm in 2015 to start the full-body scanning company Q Bio.
\- 

> these founders have deep personal motivations to keep building,
\- 

> As a culture, we have a tendency to celebrate status that emerges from net worth and network signaling rather than the work ethic of a second-act founder using his net worth and network, while he grinds on a project, to drive the world forward. This is totally backwards.
