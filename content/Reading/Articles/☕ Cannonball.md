> Orion was a part of the first mission stemming from NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to [plop humans](https://link.morningbrew.com/click/29952872.3740912/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMTItMTEvbmFzYS1zLW9yaW9uLXJldHVybnMtZnJvbS1zcGFjZS1jb21wbGV0aW5nLW1vb24tb3JiaXQtbWlzc2lvbj9zcm5kPXByZW1pdW0mc3JlZj1La1B6cFp2eg/6396c62fb716aab67a01a43dB7b663179) on the moon as soon as 2025.
> • This mission, known as Artemis I, was uncrewed, but NASA is hoping to launch Artemis II, with humans on board, by 2024.
> • Artemis III is the Holy Grail: That’s when NASA will attempt to land humans on the moon again. But given all the moving parts (a lunar lander to be provided by SpaceX, new lunar space suits), it’ll be a shock if it happens by 2025.

If the ispace vehicle makes a successful landing, it’ll be the first time a private company accomplished the feat.
