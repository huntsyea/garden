> An easy example is G2:
> 1. They read software reviews
> 2. Some leave their own software reviews
> 3. The reviews improve G2’s organic search rankings
> 4. More users find G2’s software reviews through Google’s organic search
> 5. The cycle repeats itself

> **combine growth loops** and stack them on top of each other. Let’s take a simple example: Facebook drove users early on by making it easy to invite friends. On top of this core loop, though, Google also exposed profiles on Google, which then brought in more organic traffic. Some of this traffic converted to more users. In this case, an SEO Growth Loop is stacked on top of a referral loop.

> The main questions to ask when exposing inventory on Google are “*what's the value for users*?” and “*what’s the value for creators*?”
