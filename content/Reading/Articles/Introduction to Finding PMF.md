## My Highlights
> Andy Rachleff, co-founder of Wealthfront and co-founder of Benchmark Capital, originated the term “PMF.” He emphasizes its importance by saying: “First to market seldom matters. Rather, first to PMF is almost always the long-term winner.” We can think of PMF as “being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market," a definition popularized by Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Despite the seemingly-simple definition of PMF, we as product builders know a different reality: finding PMF is quite difficult.

> We can also see the elusive nature of PMF reflected in the numbers. [In a Harvard study of 2000 venture-funded startups](https://www.geekwire.com/2012/hard-truth-report-75-percent-startups-fail/), 75% of these companies failed to find PMF. Likewise, [a second Harvard study](https://hbr.org/2013/11/a-new-model-for-innovation-in-big-companies) estimates that 70-90% of innovation projects at established organizations fail.

> he Lean Startup methodology says that product builders should forgo extensive planning, and instead push to build a minimum viable product, or MVP, as quickly as possible. This kicks off the build-measure-learn loop, through which product builders can solicit real-world customer feedback on the MVP and run additional tests to iterate their way to product success.

> It advocates for a hard stance against the prior methodology of writing overly-precise business plans and developing products in isolation, without customer feedback, over long, multi-year time periods.

> Lean quickly rose in popularity because it was a marked improvement to the dot-com era approach, emphasizing the importance of early customer feedback, as well as faster product development cycles.

> But Lean also loses sight of the bigger picture: with its singular focus on building the MVP, this methodology oversimplifies other critical elements of the PMF journey.

> To start, Lean skips the development of a thoughtful plan. Instead, it advocates a push to build an MVP as quickly as possible, which means that we spend minimal time planning beforehand. While we want to avoid overly-precise plans, having a thoughtful plan in place from the beginning *does* allow us to contemplate the nuances of our product.

> Without this, we’re likely to take shortcuts during development. For example, we may be tempted to just copy our competitors’ pricing model, which can lead us to leaving money on the table—or, conversely, charging too much. As Peter Thiel, venture capitalist and co-founder of PayPal, points out, "Why should you expect your own business to succeed without a plan to make it happen?

> Our next point is that Lean misses the opportunity to leverage other validation techniques apart from building the MVP, arguing that doing so is the quickest and easiest way to get real customer feedback on a product idea.

> While this improves upon the prior approach of long development cycles, it turns out there are other validation techniques to solicit customer feedback. These include methods such as customer interviews and prototypes, which are even faster and more cost-effective than building the MVP.

> Gagan Biyani, founder of Udemy and Spring, points out, “MVP methodology says you build an MVP, see how it goes, and slowly iterate upon it until it hits product/market fit. Instead, I believe you can more efficiently run a number of minimum viable tests, create a vision for a product that fits a market, and then go into a ‘build phase.’”

> While the methodology emphasizes the importance of defining the right core metrics and analyzing them properly, it lacks a crisp definition of how to gauge when a product has truly achieved PMF. Namely, Lean omits the much-needed specifics of what metrics to measure, how to measure them, and how to interpret the data.

> Ben Horowitz, the other co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, notes, “I am sure that Twitter knew when it achieved product/market fit, but it’s far murkier for most startups.

> *Lean* passes up the opportunity to consider traction development alongside product development. Traction refers to the initial demand that gets customers to start using our product.

> Generating traction is merely an afterthought in Lean, only addressed after product builders have built a great product. Marc Andreessen criticizes the methodology for this: “We see Lean Startup methodology being used inappropriately as an excuse to not take sales and marketing seriously.

> The ‘If you build it, they will come’ mantra is not always an acceptable approach for those looking to grow.”

> reality is that great products can still fail to find PMF if they can’t generate enough traction. While our goal pre-PMF isn’t to accelerate long-term growth, we still need to generate enough users to get customers in the door. Therefore, we need to consider traction development alongside product development as an input to finding PMF.

> Deliberate Startup methodology, developed by Sachin. This methodology is all about taking a *purposeful* approach to finding PMF by comprehensively focusing on all the critical steps that ladder up to building a successful product.

> These steps are connected by the PMF loop, which we can visualize as the interconnected gears of a watch. The loop is powered by traction as the input, just as the crown winds a watch. Each component of the PMF loop relies on the others, so we need to be deliberate in understanding how they all work together.

> First, we define our product strategy in the form of a document called the PMF narrative. Second, we validate the riskiest assumptions in our product strategy, which is again encapsulated in the PMF narrative document. Third, we quantitatively measure PMF and decide our next steps. And finally, we develop traction while simultaneously iterating through the PMF loop.
