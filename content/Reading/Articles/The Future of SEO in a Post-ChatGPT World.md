The Future of SEO in a Post-ChatGPT World - Ryan Law

## About
- Author: [[Ryan Law|Ryan Law]]
- Full Title: The Future of SEO in a Post-ChatGPT World
- Document Note: Generative AI, like ChatGPT, is likely to increase the amount of SEO content published, making it harder to compete in search engine results pages. Programmatic SEO, which may involve using AI as a creative co-pilot or an exploratory tool, will become more commonplace, and off-page ranking factors will become even more important, particularly for copycat content. Meanwhile, Google may prioritize information gain scores to reward brands for conducting research and deviating from a given SERP's status quo. Google may also prioritize off-page ranking factors over keyword relevance, while placing more emphasis on the author of the content to vouch for its authenticity. Finally, search engines like Bing and niche engines trained on specific datasets may further fragment the search ecosystem, diminishing Google's search monopoly.

## My Highlights
> Now, that bottleneck is virtually gone, and publishing twenty articles each month — or forty or a *thousand* — is much more approachable.

> We will see more companies creating more search content targeted at the same number of keywords. Much of this content will languish at zero pageviews — but not all.

> generative AI removes this constraint and creates an incentive to *publish first, think later*.

> Add in GPT-4’s ability to write and troubleshoot Python scripts for web scraping, and it becomes clear that the barriers to entry for programmatic SEO are virtually zero.

> “As the web expands, it’s increasingly costly to maintain this index and interlinking data. Authority calculation will likely shift from domains to actual authors (social media will benefit from this). So I’d rather put my money on user-signals — are the users happy with this result?”

> Google puts more emphasis on the *author* of the content and less on the content itself.

> “Now to better assess our results, E-A-T is gaining an E: experience. Does content also demonstrate that it was produced with some degree of experience, such as with actual use of a product, having actually visited a place or communicating what a person experienced? There are some situations where really what you value most is content produced by someone who has first-hand, life experience on the topic at hand.”

> Creating content that complements and builds on existing articles

> Incorporating original research into content

> This is wonderful for searchers and terrible for publishers: instead of directing searchers to your website, rewarding you for your investment in content creation, search engines could use your hard work to answer queries directly in the search results.

> LLMs make an interesting alternative possible, as demonstrated by Dan Shipper’s [Huberman bot](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/i-trained-a-gpt-3-chatbot-on-every-episode-of-my-favorite-podcast):
> • take a niche topic (“health and wellness”),
> • find a trusted data set (the Huberman Lab’s podcast),
> • and use LLM-fueled querying to build your own alternative search engine.
