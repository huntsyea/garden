## My Highlights
> We live in a hyperconnected world where you are one notification away from a dopamine hit. Too many people are focused on productivity, self-improvement, and being “always on.” The solution lies at the intersection of ancient wisdom and modern science in what Stulberg calls “groundedness” — or the art of being present every day as you take the long-term view of your work and accomplishments.
\- 

> 💡 Idea #1 — The modern world runs on heroic individualism.
\- 

> heroic individualism: an ongoing game of one-upmanship, against both yourself and others, paired with the limiting belief that measurable achievement is the only arbiter of success.
\- 

> “Heroic individualism and its most prevalent symptoms — restlessness, feeling rushed, low-level angst, scattered mess, exhaustion, burnout, periods of emptiness, a compulsion to keep chasing the next thing, and recurrent longing
\- 

> 💡 Idea #2 — Happiness seems to be a pursuit that everyone embarks on, but few people can describe what they are chasing or why.
\- 

> “We’re all affected by what behavioral scientists call hedonic adaptation, or the “set-point” theory of happiness: when we acquire or achieve something new, our happiness, well-being, and satisfaction rise, but only for a few months before returning to their prior levels.”
\- 

> 💡 Idea #3 — Groundedness is something that you have to constantly work on.
\- 

> “The six principles of groundedness are as follows: (1) Accept where you are to get you where you want to go. (2) Be present so you can own your attention and energy. (3) Be patient and you’ll get there faster. (4) Embrace vulnerability to develop genuine strength and confidence. (5) Build deep community. (6) Move your body to ground your mind.”
\- 

> 💡 Idea #4 — Brad explains that most people will succumb to a bad day, a bad emotional state, or a negative event.
\- 

> You cannot always control your circumstances, but you can control how you respond.
\- 

> 💡 Idea #5 — Multitasking is one of the worst ways to spend your time and energy.
\- 

> When we strive to be everywhere and do everything, we tend to feel like we’re not fully experiencing anything. If we’re not careful and protective of our attention, it can seem like we’re losing control of our lives, bouncing from one distraction to the next.
\- 

> A big reason that all of us can’t put down our phones or log off our email is because we’ve come to associate nonstop notifications with validating our importance in the world.
\- 

> 💡 Idea #6 — You can improve your life by focusing on what is important and focusing when you have the opportunity to spend time with the people, or on the things, that you deem most important.
\- 

> 💡 Idea #7 — The modern world, especially the technology industry, has celebrated the individuals with the biggest goals.
\- 

> “Rather than focusing on the heroic achievement of big goals, practice breaking them down into their component parts and then concentrate on those parts. Doing so serves as an incredibly powerful focusing mechanism.”
\- 

> 💡 Idea #8 — Life is all about operating in an ever-changing environment. The more easily that you can navigate various aspects of life, the more prepared you are to succeed.
\- 

> 💡 Idea #9 — Technology is a blessing and a curse.
\- 

> (1) Digital technology has created the ability — and ensuing pressure — for us to “optimize” and be productive always, which often comes at the expense of time and energy spent building deep community. (2) Many digital technologies offer us the illusion of connection while eroding the real thing.”
\- 

> 1. Living a grounded life is an ongoing practice.
\- 

> It’s one thing to understand something intellectually. It’s another to make it real, day in and day out.
\- 

> Language shapes reality.
\- 

> “A wandering mind is an unhappy mind.” - Harvard researchers
\- 

> Doing stuff is only valuable if the stuff we are doing is valuable.
\- 

> “Attention is a finite resource and attention vampires are lurking everywhere, literally sucking the life out of us.” - Ed Batista
\- 

> People often think about the number of years in their lives. But perhaps more important is the amount of life, the amount of presence, in those years.
\- 

> Heroic individualism craves instant wealth, instant health, and instant happiness.
\- 

> The great paradox, of course, is that rates of loneliness are skyrocketing at a time when we are more connected, at least digitally, than ever.
\- 

> We are most satisfied when we fulfill both of these essential drives: an inner feeling of belonging and appropriate outward contact with other people.
\- 

> Pain isn’t the only contagious emotion.
\- 

> You don’t become what you think. You become what you do.
