> 🌟 **Pinterest Is Testing New Top-of-Screen Ads**
> 📰 **TL;DR -** Pinterest is testing out a new “Premiere Spotlight” ad spot on their app, which places a brand’s promotion in prime real estate at the top of the app’s search page. They’re testing the feature in beta with select partners, including Kohl’s, but expect a full launch later this year. The Spotlight tile will give advertisers the prime position for 24 hours with video promotions that activate in-stream, plus a website CTA that opens the brand’s website within the Pinterest app.
