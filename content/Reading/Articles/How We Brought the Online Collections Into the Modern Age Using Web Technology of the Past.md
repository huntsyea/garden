## My Highlights
> The irony of using actual, HTML-based, old-school web pages and touting it’s performance benefits over cutting-edge Javascript-based front-end technology is not lost on me. Perhaps a shallow comparison can be drawn between the trends of web development and fashion – “what’s old is new again”. In web development a familiar trend appears: wide adoption of a new [abstraction utilising a new framework or library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) (perhaps without consideration how of suited that abstraction might be for individual projects), [realising that abstraction has an impact on performance](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size), [then pairing back that abstraction until we are left with the original](https://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/why-not/).
