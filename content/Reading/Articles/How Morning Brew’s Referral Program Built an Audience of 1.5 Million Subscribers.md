## My Highlights
> My goal was simply to build anything that would grow the audience.

> Up until that point, all of our growth had come from word-of-mouth and the nonstop hustle of the Brew’s 2 co-founders, Alex Lieberman and Austin Rief.

> After a few months, I turned my attention to maximize the value of the 100,000 existing and passionate subscribers.

> While the referral program obviously doesn’t account for all 1.5 million subscribers we have today (we began pursuing paid acquisition in early 2018), it does account for over 30% of our total subscribers and is the “secret sauce” that makes our growth flywheel spin.

> Rule #1: Start with the product
> When looking to maximize growth, there are two essential criteria to consider:
> 1. Is the product valuable to the end user/customer?
> 2. How can you build growth mechanisms natively into the product?

> Morning Brew has implemented a milestone-based referral program,
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fn8serq420fpyspsp6p47))

> Our referral program is entirely custom-built using Ruby on Rails and a few integrations with our ESP (email service provider), Sailthru
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fnhtertzb2n4qsxs51qgv))

> Morning Brew uses a double opt-in process to confirm every email is legitimate (nice try poop@gmail.com).
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fpf4ydkkvka77yxry8005))

> We initially didn’t require referrals to double opt-in and confirm their email because it creates an additional barrier to signing up. However, to appease the email gods — I decided it was in the best interest of the company to make the switch.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fr2fskn2sbme7kz9hmqy3))

> When building a referral program, it’s important to consider all sorts of tradeoffs — whether it’s profits, time, or something else specific to your business.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4frj48ettfb86qr6vq8hbv))

> I’ve also built an integration with Forest Admin to create an admin panel with custom functions that allows our lovely interns the ability to provide some basic level of “customer service.”
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4ft8bkb1t8wpx0y0q7hx5f))

> It’s extremely important that you’re able to effectively manage the referral program and take care of those who are going out of their way to share your product with others.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4ftpwpzjrr163f2xksxxqz))

> We also leverage the passionate community of Morning Brew Insiders (more on that in a moment) conduct polls and facilitate discussions.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fvkdnmxta9en5mc1xy73d))

> The result: a milestone-based rewards program that was extremely calculated and demand-driven.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fvrnxx5439f28yz5rmsj0))

> first reward at just **3 referrals** is Light Roast, an exclusive Sunday newsletter.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fws500ns4mr5qcz0cftyx))

> It’s likely that additional “exclusive” content is aligned with the interests of a reader
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fx2dbq7pnc5xegce0a0ap))

> It’s completely free for us. We don’t need to purchase raw goods,
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fx55ab6apq28n5y8pzagp))

> Light Roast is currently sent to over 75,000 subscribers each Sunday. That is, over 75,000 people have shared Morning Brew with at least 3 people.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fxn7gsycst4kessc8gr7a))

> **5 referrals:** we mail readers Morning Brew stickers. Bulk ordering 10,000 die cut stickers from StickerMule breaks down to a unit cost of $0.20/sticker and our pre-stamped envelopes cost roughly $0.65/envelope. That totals roughly $1.25 in cost, or a $0.25 CPA (cost per acquisition) for 5 new subscribers to the Brew.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fya1hv3mz2kyw55m9mx97))

> For reference, the CPA for us on Facebook/Instagram, our largest paid acquisition channels, is typically between $3 and $5.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fykx36q8spqpnt5519pqf))

> **10 referrals:** readers gain access to our exclusive “Insider” community. The private Facebook group, which is quickly approaching 10,000 members, is *the* place to discuss the latest stories, trends, and events in business, pursue career opportunities, and network with other like-minded Brew readers
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fz7r55jz1denp4zm5qt6m))

> **15 referrals:** we mail readers a custom Morning Brew silicone phone wallet.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4fzx4xa5rd3eg9c3qxrbb1))

> When someone refers 15 people, the CPA on those referred is $0.23 ((cost of phone wallet + stickers)/15). We’ve actually managed to spend less per subscriber as someone continues to refer additional people.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g08h04427gvtnx5j7an2v))

> **25 referrals:** we ship readers a super soft Morning Brew tri-blend t-shirt.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g0qx8w5ga1vn8ff86tw0m))

> Now, the reaction to the shirts is overwhelmingly positive and you can find no fewer than 4 people wearing them in the office on any given day.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g101kzkj3qpvyz9h0zp89))

> **50 referrals:** we ship readers a Morning Brew “Rise and Grind” coffee mug (a fan favorite).
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g1754z3fdy2tpkqr0k2jm))

> **100 referrals:** we ship a “Brewneck” (Morning Brew crewneck sweatshirt).
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g1f4yqydfv1vjms48hh85))

> Not only do you want those who refer 100 people to feel appreciated in receiving quality swag, but when it doubles as a comfortable product…people actually *prefer* to wear it.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g1z077rm1t3tt8hgxward))

> the rewards program is effective in incentivizing our most engaged readers to share the Brew with others.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g25wftr1mf4hqdm6fyyvt))

> You can also make the argument that the swag doubles as an indirect marketing channel, meaning that when someone is walking around wearing a Morning Brew t-shirt or drinking from a Morning Brew coffee mug in the office, it’s increasing our brand’s exposure.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g2fn0pzz14tag7rkasq7a))

> If someone goes out of their way to share a product or service with their friends, classmates, co-workers, etc., I think the likelihood they continue to engage with that product increases.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g2t4x4e8f4qxhw6bws6a8))

> **1. Educate**
> People first need to know you *have* a rewards program (and how it works) before it can become effective.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g39tkrtbsws5yde99ze98))

> **2. Motivate**
> We motivate users by providing a real-time counter that tracks how many referrals someone has, along with some encouragement: “You’re only X referrals away from receiving Y!”
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g3fspav9t5sp7d0tejpms))

> **3. Assist**
> This is where you do all you can to make actually sharing your product as easy as possible. The ultimate goal here is to remove any bit of friction.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g3q7r789edsfxgztp9gnv))

> **When it comes to providing options, sometimes less is more.**
> For example, people who are referred via email have a conversion rate of 75% on our landing page.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g4j4nx7hhztc3008v74f7))

> Depending on the source, site visitors respond to different messaging. Facebook ads, blog posts, and in this case, referrals, are all driving traffic to our site.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g5w6zn1kh6jezdwnfcfxq))

> We use Google Optimize to test every aspect of our landing page, and that’s especially important for optimizing incoming traffic from our referral program. We split our testing audiences into two main cohorts: referrals via email invites and all other referrals.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g64ps9z9asgpsj9289hdz))

> For example, we tested our original landing page against a new design with copy that called out that your friend recommended you sign up for this.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g72vzc9kbgz5jqf957zf5))

> By running the same test of original landing page vs. new designs, we were able to increase the conversion rate of traffic via email invites by over 7%.

> Newsletter share section
> If I broke the entire referral process into a funnel, it would look like this.

> Our referral funnel
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g7sr62mb4r5m3qgjnmxkh))

> We have a dedicated “Share The Brew” section included in every single newsletter we send.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g893vxrxc03pw3ca7ads9))

> To emphasize the importance of this section:
> 1. We send our daily email to 1.5M people every morning
> 2. ~45% of people open the newsletter on any given day
> 3. ~**X**% of these people click the “Click to Share” button (which links to their unique referral hub) on any given day
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g8ctp63tprnsjk16yz8pc))

> The different features within the referral hub, the rewards we offer, and the conversion rate of our landing pages don’t even matter if readers don’t engage with the “Share the Brew” section in our newsletter (that is, we need to optimize the bolded **X** in step #3 above).
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g94tav4s439e4syemse7r))

> Our generic share section accomplishes similar goals to the referral hub. We provide a value proposition at the top, give the reader an update on their current referral count, and outline all of the rewards in a visual and easy-to-digest manner.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g9pq41pksjnkbxqe76h1b))

> We also aim to remove as much friction as possible
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4g9xbnc5smwtw9d6ydwec7))

> For example, if you have fewer than 3 referrals, we know you don’t have access to Light Roast. Therefore we can show you a share section dedicated exclusively to Light Roast
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gaz4wc6afe0dkymxpv3zq))

> as opposed to someone with 20 referrals who would likely see something about being 5 referrals away from an awesome Brew t-shirt

> Newsletter share section promoting Light Roast (left) and t-shirts (right)
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gbcbx5fes653xpexvtz5d))

> To ensure this section doesn’t get too stale, we are constantly changing what a reader sees on any given day based on their referral count.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gbhgew7d0vavfegsbjmn4))

> if you have 0 referrals: on Monday you’ll see a plug about Light Roast, Tuesday you’ll see something about stickers, Wednesday a t-shirt, Thursday a coffee mug, etc.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gbs9a3hn844wdtzfg1yvj))

> we also send many one-off “transactional” emails to our readers. The primary objective of the emails is to boost the effectiveness of the referral program
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gch2t6mbqs87r7ayf7xj0))

> **The Initial Ask**
> The reality is that the vast majority of our readers have 0 referrals. Convincing someone to go out of their way to share our product (or any product) is a challenge, so most of our focus goes into enticing them to get from 0 to 1 referral. Once a reader gets their very first referral, it’s apparent that they:
> 1. Acknowledge the existence of the rewards program
> 2. Are incentivized by the rewards
> 3. Understand how to share their unique link
> 4. Have received some sort of gratification for doing so
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gcpjwpgdkcjevd4cs67rs))

> **Milestone emails**
> These emails are triggered after your first successful referral and at each subsequent referral milestone in which you unlock some sort of reward (5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 100, 1,000). The purpose of these emails: to acknowledge the reader’s accomplishment, show them how to redeem their reward (if necessary), and to motivate them to hit the next milestone.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gd4hs62rtswnh0y7srgp5))

> **Nudge Emails**
> The lowest hanging fruit in the pipeline is what I call “nudge emails.” Essentially, readers who have been stuck for two weeks just one referral away from a milestone (2, 4, 9) receive an email to nudge them to get that one last referral.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gd9dgb2pc2qk0qm35bga1))

> **Giveaways**
> If you’ve been a subscriber of Morning Brew for more than a few months, you’ve probably noticed that we do a big giveaway every 4–5 weeks. It’s nothing revolutionary, but it’s a massive stimulant to the referral program.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gdkcapqyvp50km28d77cd))

> Conclusion
> Over 225,000 people have referred at least one person to subscribe to Morning Brew. During the summer of 2018, we had months where we averaged over 1,000 referrals per day (it’s obviously increased since, but that’s all I’m going to give you here).
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gk4gebxq27wemrg44qgr9hv5))

> A few things we’re continuing to evaluate:
> 1. What other rewards could we introduce or substitute that would increase demand while remaining cost-effective?
> 2. How can we continue to optimize the language around the referral program to entice a larger portion of our audience to participate?
> 3. Should we introduce additional sharing functionality to provide more options for readers to share, or in contrast, remove some features to simplify the process?
> 4. Can we coincide this rewards program with organic social media campaigns to showcase subscribers reading the Brew and wearing our swag?
> 5. Are there parts of the pipeline where additional nudges are needed, or are there redundancies that can be removed?
