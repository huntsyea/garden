## My Highlights
> If you want to find something worthwhile on Google, append the word "Reddit" to your query. If you're doing this already, you know that it's because: 1. You don't want to be sold to by blogs that have mastered the search engine gaming system, or search engine optimization (SEO). 2. You want to hear from other people, not companies. 3. You'd rather just get the recipe, not the life story.
