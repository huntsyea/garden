> try to make connections with this list of values and beliefs of the synthesizer:
> • Money is a tool for building what you want but doesn't exist.
> • You live in a time where you can create your own career, rather than be assigned one.
> • Personal responsibility determines the outcome of your life in a decentralized economy.
> • You won't get average results with average goals. You will get rare results with rare goals.
> • Curiosity, reality exploration, and eventual obsession with a craft is your key to greatness.
> • Self-education is a cornerstone habit that you must do every single day, no matter the topic of study.
> • Humans are meant to expand, transcend, and create. Constant self-improvement and evolution is not optional. If you as an individual get stuck, so will your endeavors.
> • There is a way to build whatever life you want with technology and the internet. If there isn't a way, create it.
