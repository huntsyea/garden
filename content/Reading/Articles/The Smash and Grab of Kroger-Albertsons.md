## My Highlights
> Last week, supermarket chain Kroger announced it would be buying Albertsons for $24 billion, in the largest grocery acquisition in U.S. history. Kroger and Albertsons are both monsters, and the two of them combining would create the second largest chain in the country, after Walmart, with 15% of the national grocery business.
