> Eat The Frog forces you to focus on less, even when you know you can do more. Any day that you eat your frog is a good day. Furthermore, following the method means you’ll be making progress on something meaningful on a daily basis.

> When you experience a win first thing in the morning, you’re more likely to build momentum and good vibes to carry you through the rest of your workday.

> It takes full advantage of your best work hours
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgqzatj3ssjqzxdn7ya7c5))

> Eat the Frog ensures that you’re using your best hours to do your most mentally taxing work and leaves less important tasks for times when you’ve already exhausted your brain power for the day.

> It’s dead simple and infinitely flexible

> Eat The Frog is a simple method anyone can fall back on at any time with very little time or mental resources required. And it’s almost universally applicable

> 1. Decide on your frog
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgsjvbphxfbng2pvesa1kj))

> Also known as your Most Important Task (MIT). This task is often [important but not urgent](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix), the type of difficult task that creates a lot of mental resistance and ensuing procrastination if you don't intentionally make time for it.

> 2. Pick something you'll be able to complete in 1-4 hours
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgt4xmjamb52rm17d44jt5))

> Your frog should take half a day’s work, tops. A clearly defined, realistic task will make it easier to get started and not procrastinate on.

> 3. Break it down into smaller steps if needed
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgtpxwn81hx4m7wvz8sc77))

> If your frog is going to take more than half a day, break it down into smaller steps that will take 4 hours or less. The next concrete action on that list is your new frog

> 4. Resist the temptation to plan ahead
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgvaw19v71vz91ea7gv4yn))

> Once you start breaking your big tasks down, you may be tempted to schedule out your frogs for the whole week or several weeks to come. Don’t do it! Accurately forecasting tasks into the future is nearly impossible and will only set you up for getting behind quickly.

> 5. Prepare your frog the night before
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgvyd6vghe1ecak1j3d9tr))

> The night before, you’re close enough to be able to plan accurately, but still far enough removed from actually having to do it for too much mental resistance to kick in

> example, today my frog was to finish the first draft of this guide. Yesterday before closing my computer at the end of the workday, I closed out all of my other tabs and apps but left my research and outline Word document open in full-screen “Focus” mode so it was the first and only thing I saw when I sat down to work this morning.

> 6. Eat your frog first thing

> Whatever your frog for the day happens to be, do it first thing when you sit down to work. If at all possible, don’t schedule meetings. Don’t catch up on Twitter. Don’t check your email. Don’t even think about thinking about all the other less important things you’ll have to do later in the day.

> Using priority levels
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbgyfn456gm693wv881sy5s))

> Identify your most important task and [mark it P1](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205873321?itm_campaign=eat_the_frog&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides). You’ll need to be very disciplined with your use of “priority 1” as you’ll only get one P1 task per day.

> [Create a new filter](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205248842-Filters?itm_campaign=eat_the_frog&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) called “Today’s Frog 🐸” using the query “p1 & today”. This filtered view will show just your P1 tasks due today — in other words, your single frog for the day.

> [Pin the filter to your favorites](https://doist.com/blog/introducing-todoist-favorites/?itm_campaign=eat_the_frog&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) so it’s always visible above your project list in your left-hand navigation menu.

> Using labels
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpbh0bvmf48qgx4wecysgnjp))

> If you already use priority levels in a different way, you can also use an “@frog 🐸” [label](https://get.todoist.help/hc/en-us/articles/205195042-Labels?itm_campaign=eat_the_frog&itm_medium=referral&itm_source=productivity_methods_guides) to identify your most important task of the day. You can either pin the label directly to your favorites or create a filter with the query “@frog & today” to show you all tasks labeled @frog that are due today.
