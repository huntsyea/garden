## My Highlights
> Michael Dubakov is the CEO of [Fibery](https://fibery.io?utm_source=nesslabs&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=michael_interview), an all-in-one workspace allowing the whole company to do everything together, whether it’s research, product development, marketing, customer management, and more.

> Productivity tools should increase productivity, right? But productivity of knowledge workers is extremely hard to measure. There is no good metric yet.

> I think the proper metric is the quality and quantity of insights.

> It’s a piece of new knowledge. It can take many forms: a new question, a new answer to an existing question, a new theory, a new proof, a new experiment, etc.

> knowledge economy, we compete with knowledge, not efficiency

> productivity tools create silos
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkejhavvbm0h5jykyzsaafa))

> tools create many walls and barriers inside a company. As a result, it is much harder to extract and connect information.

> Connections are really important here, this is how we discover novelty

> tool should support information and process evolution

> need a tool that accumulates, mixes, connects, and visualizes structured and unstructured information in a single space
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkf6qtkjc6dd4dr3tasdp34))

> I define intelligence as quantity and quality of insights.

> Surprisingly, [hypertext tools from the 80’s](https://fibery.io/blog/hypertext-tools-from-the-80s?utm_source=nesslabs&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=michael_interview) were very powerful

> A dream tool should combine work management and knowledge management processes together. It should work very well with unstructured information that has poor meta-data (note, chat, text, document, diagram) and with structured information that has rich meta-data (task, product, protein formula).

> be a single point of truth
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkeqj4mpej1whq5z2jee8ab))

> break information silos, replace many tools, and fetch data from those tools it can’t replace.

> Fibery core is what we call a “flexible domain”. You can create your own structures and hierarchies that represent how your company operates
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkfn5s5f0j1fdwhqjc53egw))

> Third, this tool should support connectivity. All information should be connected via all kinds of links
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkex64rh6ff0g53tzw7cf1n))

> Fibery power is that you can replicate any domain. You can fetch data from dozens of systems (Intercom, GitLab, GitHub, Airtable, Braintree, Zendesk, etc) and connect this data to other databases.

> My favorite use case is feedback accumulation and prioritization
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gjkfrprwmey0dp9rf6y7fhnx))

> these links are bi-directional. When you navigate to some feature, you will find all the feedback inside linked to it. Eventually feedback accumulates and you can create a list that shows what features or insights are requested by customers and leads more often

> single person who builds first spaces and only then invites teammates. This is a good idea, since collaborative workspace building is possible, but only for the skilled people who are already fluent in Fibery.
