## My Highlights
> Developed by Kevin Kruse (author of ‚ÄòGreat Leaders Have No Rules‚Äô), the 3-21-0 Method is elegantly simple:
> **3 Email Processing Sessions Daily**: Limit yourself to checking emails just three times a day.
> **21 Minutes Per Session**: Spend only 21 minutes in each session.
> **0 Emails Left**: Aim for an empty inbox ‚Äì also known as 'inbox zero'.

> Before adopting the 3-21-0 Method, you‚Äôre going to want to achieve an initial inbox zero:
> 1. Create a new folder named ‚ÄúOld Inbox‚Äù.
> 2. Move all existing emails into this folder.
> 3. Relish the sight of an empty inbox ‚Äì your new baseline.
> 4. Now, schedule your three daily sessions. It‚Äôs a good idea to have one in the morning, one in the early afternoon, and one in the late afternoon/evening.
