## My Highlights
> Krispy Kreme has had a stunning comeback. What happened, exactly? In short, the company got ahead of its skis in the 2000s. People loved Krispy Kreme for its promise of “Hot Doughnuts Now”, emblazoned on neon signs in front of stores.

> There’s an aphorism in business I’ve always loved (I believe it traces back to Stephen Covey originally): *“The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”* Krispy Kreme strayed from the main thing, and consumers punished the company for it.

> Schultz closed Starbucks stores for a day to retrain baristas in making the best espresso. (That move cost the company an estimated $6 million.) Schultz then upgraded espresso machines worldwide to the Swiss-made Mastrena, decided to only deliver whole-bean coffee to stores, and required baristas to grind beans in-store.

> In 2021—19 years into the company’s life—Crocs revenue grew 67% (!) to $2.3 billion. Profit margins in 2021 improved from 22% to 31%. This followed nearly a decade of flat sales and stagnant margins.

> Some of 2021’s growth stemmed from a COVID-induced boom in comfort wear, sure, but much of it came from renewed *focus*. In 2020-2021, Crocs trimmed its product selection by 30-40%, which helped the company improve margins and refocus marketing efforts on its iconic clogs

> Crocs doubled down on Jibbitz, little charms that let people customize their Crocs. All of a sudden, Crocs became a vehicle for showcasing personality and uniqueness.

> Alongside refocusing on its marquee clog, Crocs went all-in on collaborations. The goal was to inject coolness into the brand through *affiliation*

> The common denominator of the turnarounds at Krispy Kreme, Starbucks, and Crocs was a renewed focus on the main thing. Another way I’ve heard it phrased in the startup world: “Keep it simple, stupid.” Don’t forget what your business stands for.

> Companies often lose sight of the main thing because of pressure to grow. This was especially true in the last decade, with the market rewarding growth over profitability.

> Uber got distracted by expensive self-driving car efforts, which kept the company from nailing the unit economics underlying its core business

> Google got distracted by its many moonshots (RIP [Project Loon](https://x.company/projects/loon/)), which it could afford because of its cash cow core business but which led to bloat and complacency in search

> can anyone seriously say that Meta remains committed to its mission statement of ‘bringing the world closer together’? The company is so focused on competing with TikTok that it has lost its ability to a) innovate without acquisition, and b) facilitate true connection.
