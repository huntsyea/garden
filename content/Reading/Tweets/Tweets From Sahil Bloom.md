## My Highlights
> **Richard Feynman's love letter to his late wife is the best thing you'll read today.**
> Feynman had married his high school sweetheart after her diagnosis with terminal tuberculosis.
> They were married for three years.
> He penned this love letter to her 16 months after she passed.
> Feynman never released the letter—it was only found after his death during research for a book on his life.
> The writing is as raw and real as it comes:
> *"I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you."*
> *"I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you."*
> *"My darling wife, I do adore you. I love my wife. My wife is dead."*
> It closes with a quintessentially witty line:
> *"PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address."*
> This is beautiful.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAgTKq-WMAAer2-.jpg'/>
