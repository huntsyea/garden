## My Highlights
> OpenAI's Unaddressed Lobotomization of GPT4
> Analyzing the regression of response quality over time; in particular, focusing on the adherence to custom instructions. 
> (October 30th → December 3rd) 🧵

> On October 30th, I decided that I would test GPT4's chemistry-problem-solving acuity while simultaneously creating a robust set of custom instructions which would bolster any discovered weak points in the hopes of improving the efficacy of generated responses.

> What I have discovered is that by finding particular prompts that GPT has trouble with and then refining prompt structure/custom instructions until consistent accurate responses are achieved, you can significantly tamper down any future issues that may arise with similar problems

> For example, for some reason, GPT4 had difficulty completing and then balancing the following reaction in spite of its ability to do so. Perhaps this is due to an already-built-in laziness, however, that is an unacceptable reason for failure and it can often be engineered around.

> Photo 1) Identified issue as a part of a two-question prompt, eventually it took two prompts
> Photo 2) Attempted it in different, new chat and it returned an incorrect answer
> Photo 3) Tried with my -lo, limited output flag , received inconsistent results

> The next time GPT returned the correct answer, I had it explain to me the methodology it followed, asking how I could best guide it next time. I then had it condense the methodology into a single sentence, which I then finally inputted into my custom instructions.

> Awesome. That's a wrap, right? Unfortunately not.
> Despite all of hard work that myself and many others have put into crafting the best, tailored custom instructions, it seems that among other limitations put on GPT Plus users, custom instructions are no longer adhered to.

> For example, here is the same prompt given first on October 31th and next on December 2nd:
> (Left)
> Date: October 30st, 2023
> Words: 287
> Characters: 1985
> Referenced Instructions: Yes
> (Right)
> Date: December 2nd, 2023
> Words: 201
> Characters: 1386
> Referenced Instructions: No

> In this period of about a month, 
> Bing has been integrated as a means to search for answers
> Python has be utilized much more heavily as means to perform computation
> GPT4 rate limited to 40messages/3hours
> OAI pauses GPT Plus subscriptions for new users

> Meanwhile, temporarily rolling out paid features to non-paying users…

> OpenAI’s inability to scale affordably, despite their partnership with Microsoft, has left dedicated users without recourse as GPT4 continues to be neutered. Tasks they’ve become reliant on automating have been interrupted by both a decrease in efficacy and increased rate limits.

> What’s more, the slow degradation of GPT4’s custom instruction adherence comes without any official acknowledgment by OpenAI. 
> Users are left to uncover for themselves that prompts that previously yielded results may no longer.

> The closest thing to acknowledgement by OpenAI is a member of their Developer Relations team stating on X that they are “working hard to address this.”
