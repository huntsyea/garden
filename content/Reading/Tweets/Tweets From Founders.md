## My Highlights
> Steve Jobs found lessons in *every* experience and brought those ideas back to Apple. 
> I found 4 surprising examples spread across 4 different books. 
> 1. How to recruit talent from J. Robert Oppenheimer:
> “At Pixar, it was a whole company of A players. When I got back to Apple, that's what I decided to try to do. 
> My role model was J. Robert Oppenheimer. 
> I read about the type of people he sought for the atom bomb project. 
> I wasn't nearly as good as he was, but that's what I aspired to do.”
> 📖 from Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson 
> 2. The importance of not cutting corners from his Dad:
> Jobs’ father was a formative influence on his son’s appreciation of design. 
> “My father loved doing things right. He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t see.” 
> His father refused to build a fence that wasn’t constructed as well on the back side as it was the front. 
> “For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.” 
> 📖 from Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple’s Greatest Products by Leander Kahney
> 3. Product line uniformity from Paris architecture:
> The city’s architecture fascinated him. 
> He saw a simplicity and uniformity of design in the buildings—so many of them seven or eight stories tall and made of similar yellow stone, exuding an elegance and consistency that instilled a sense of harmony in the brain. 
> Steve’s point was that you could parachute anywhere into the city and realize you were nowhere but Paris. 
> “There aren’t many cities where you can do that,” he pointed out. 
> “The architecture here creates a unique signature for the entire city.” 
> That Parisian simplicity was something he wanted Apple to emulate.
> 📖 from Finding The Next Steve Jobs by Nolan Bushnell 
> 4. The importance of insanely simple interfaces from working at Atari: 
> Jobs later said he learned some important lessons at Atari, the most profound being the need to keep interfaces friendly and intuitive. 
> Instructions should be insanely simple: 
> “Insert quarters, avoid Klingons.” 
> Devices should not need manuals. 
> That simplicity rubbed off on him and made him a very focused product person.
> 📖 from The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution by Walter Isaacson<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAYFKVSWUAACyS6.jpg'/>
