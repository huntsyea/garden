## My Highlights
> **$204,008**
> November, month two of roofing business, here is what I learned
> **Costs:**
> **Spent 60,000** 
> As expected costs went down, there will still some larger purchases on this balance sheet
> I think I probably undershot my expectation overhead might be closer to 50k a month
> **Employees:**
> This month was kind of a mixed back if I am being honest 
> Fired a few employees
> Promoted two employees into management (one handling back office, one handling lead generation) 
> **Revenue:**
> **$303,151** in signed contracts, $**99,143** in cancellations 
> Deal type breakdown: 
> 6 solar 
> 6 roof 
> 3 window 
> 2 attic installation 
> Ended the month with 10 signed contracts and $204,408 in booked jobs 
> These are in different parts of the pipeline wanted to make sure I clarified from my last update, **we have not collected full payment** on all these jobs
> Depending on the components of the deal our maximum installation is 6 weeks 
> I should also probably clarify that this revenue is mostly from Mighty Dog, but we started a second entity to deal with things outside the scope of the franchise (like fences, insulation etc)
> **What we are trying:**
> We have two primary projects we are focusing on to hopefully move the needle:
> **1. Building out a call center **
> We are putting a large amount of capitol towards building out a call center with <a href="https://twitter.com/coleruudjohnson">@coleruudjohnson</a> , our hope is that this can generate 50-75 leads weekly pretty quickly
> If this plays out as we hope we will probably triple down on this within 60 days 
> **2. Recruiting more sales reps**
> Our team just brought on a recruiting firm with the goal of having 12 great sales reps by the end of March 
> Also investing in coaching to help our management team to have the systems and trainings to support this growth with <a href="https://twitter.com/pinpulleddrmf">@pinpulleddrmf</a> 
> **Conclusion:**
> November was really hard, had some tough cancellations and didn't get the results we wanted 
> **I hate losing, **and this month felt like a loss full stop
> I have heard from other roofers that its the hardest month by far
> Hoping to put in the work to have a better December 
> Would love to get closer to our October Numbers to end the year 
> Hope this is helpful if you're thinking about or building your business, I am in the trenches with you<video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/GAS8N9aXMAAkU2u.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
