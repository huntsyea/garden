## My Highlights
> Interesting! Apparently, Google's Gemini is **as good as **GPT-4 in "some respects."
> However, they are holding back so they can improve in other languages!! 🤯🤯
> Wh**at even!! Th**ey are so far behind ChatGPT right now that they should be shipping ASAP 🚢
> Ship quickly and early, and then iterate!!<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GAXPQyZb0AALbGV.png'/>
