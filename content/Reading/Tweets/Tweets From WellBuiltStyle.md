## My Highlights
> It's true that owning a half dozen pairs of $30-50 jeans will give you more variety. 
> But the reality is that you'll wear just 1-2 pairs regularly. 
> Probably makes more sense to spend MORE on just a single pair of beautiful jeans that will be THE jeans you wear with almost everything.

> For the single men out there: 
> Give women an excuse to touch you. Make it an invitation through your appearance. 
> You do this by...
> 1) Being in solid shape
> 2) Smelling nice
> 3) Wearing fabrics with a luxurious/soft hand feel like cashmere, fine corduroy, brushed flannel etc.

> Design specs for the most versatile suit you can own:
> A simple suit like this will also have the most staying power. 
> If you don't own a suit or don't wear one often this is the way you want to go.
> Custom/bespoke or MTM (made to measure) is favorable but off the rack can suffice.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GASeDIDaUAA-owy.jpg'/>
