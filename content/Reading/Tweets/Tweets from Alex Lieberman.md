## My Highlights
> I’ve been an amazing procrastinator for 10+ years.
> And I’ve tried just about everything to be less distractible & more focused.
> Website disabler.
> Dumb phone.
> Todo list.
> Wife given passcode.
> Timeblocking.
> Pomodoro.
> None of it worked.
> But in the last week I found my crystal key.
> I shit you not my procrastination is down >90%.
> I started doing virtual coworking through a site called <a href="https://twitter.com/focusmate">@focusmate</a>.
> 1) I pick a 30-75 min block for deep work
> 2) Focusmate pairs me with a buddy
> 3) The block starts, we both show up on video, state our goals, and get to work. Cameras stay on, mics muted.
> 4) While working we can type in the chat as we complete tasks
> 5) At the end of the block we share how it went and what we accomplished
> To some, this may sound crazy.
> But it works…mainly because of this concept called body-doubling…
> This idea that by having a friend or partner who works simultaneously, either IRL or virtually, productivity goes up.
> Lots of theories for why it works (dopamine, mirror neurons, Hawthorne effect, etc), but all I can say is it just does.
> Plus, meeting people from all over the world working on interesting things has been an cool added benefit.
> P.S. I’m not paid by/affiliated with the company. I just want more people to have a holy shit moment like I did.
