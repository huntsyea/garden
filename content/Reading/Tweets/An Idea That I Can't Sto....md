## My Highlights
> An idea that I can't stop thinking about:
> The Capability Gap
> Alabama coach Nick Saban refers to the Capability Gap in this clip from a discussion with Holly Rowe:
> "We oftentimes talk about what someone's potential is, but I think to put it in better terms...the Capability Gap is what you're capable of relative to what you're doing...if you understand the truth about that, you can actually take information that can help you close that gap."
> The Capability Gap is a simple idea with powerful implications across all areas of your life.
> It requires an understanding of:
> 1. Your full capability
> 2. Your current delivery
> In my experience, I would argue that most people underestimate their full capability and overestimate their current delivery.
> In other words, they think their Capability Gap is very small, when in reality it's much larger than they realize.
> Having mentors, coaches, friends, and family members who help you see the truth about your full capability and keep you honest on your current level of delivery is everything.
> This isn't about sports, this is about your life:
> Do you have people in your life who help you think bigger about what you're capable of?
> Do you have people in your life who tell you that your current delivery isn't good enough?
> We all need those people in our lives.
> We need people who push us to get uncomfortable, to think bigger, and to be better.
> We need people who push us to be better partners, parents, friends, siblings, colleagues, community members, and leaders.
> Find the people who tell you the two truths:
> 1. What you're truly capable of
> 2. What you're currently delivering on
> Identify your Capability Gap and then work relentlessly to close it!

> A framing that has helped me:
> Collect more Intellectual Sparring Partners.
> These are people who:
> • Call you on your BS or excuses
> • Question your assumptions
> • Push you to think bigger
> Intellectual Sparring Partners help you clarify your Capability Gap (and close it).

> Here's a clip of Nick Saban talking about the Capability Gap on the <a href="https://twitter.com/PatMcAfeeShow">@PatMcAfeeShow</a> recently:
> "We sometimes assume that just because someone has talent, they want to be the best that they can be. But that's not necessarily the case, so you're always trying to close that gap." <video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1730620616716230659/pu/vid/avc1/960x504/sv4H1g9XHgHggkUe.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1730620616716230659/pu/vid/avc1/684x360/dLjEnI-Ue6MbOzWN.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1730620616716230659/pu/pl/dvi-e14-Y3UN-Tqj.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1730620616716230659/pu/vid/avc1/514x270/kpwE0k03OQWXLpN3.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>

> <a href="https://twitter.com/PatMcAfeeShow">@PatMcAfeeShow</a> The Capability Gap is a function of:
> 1. Your full capability
> 2. Your current delivery
> A fixed mindset believes these are static.
> That’s wrong—both 1 and 2 are dynamic:
> A growth mindset believes that 1 can be constantly expanded and 2 can be constantly improved.

> After my sophomore year of high school, my coach asked if I wanted to pitch in college.
> I said I wasn't good enough.
> He told me I was capable of pitching at Stanford, but that it would take a lot of work.
> I laughed out loud.
> 18 months later, I got a scholarship to Stanford.
