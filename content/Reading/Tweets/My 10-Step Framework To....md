## My Highlights
> My 10-step framework to get 12 hours of work done in 3:
> 1) Leverage Nicotine

> I know what you’re thinking.
> How the fuck are you gonna recommend people use nicotine?
> Because my beliefs recently flipped.
> I used to think nicotine was bad.
> But it’s not the nicotine that's bad.
> It’s the MEDIUM in which the nicotine is delivered.

> Vaping and Cigs?
> Stay away.
> But nicotine gum, zyns, or lozenges?
> They're actually great tools.
> If you don’t believe me, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterAttiaMD">@PeterAttiaMD</a>'s recent take.
> Completely shattered my beliefs:

> 2) Caffeine
> Caffeine is a miracle drug.
> It:
> • Enhances focus
> • Increases energy
> •  Increases dopamine
> ~ 200 mg is the sweet spot where my typing speed doubles but not to the point of anxiety.

> 3) 32 oz of Water
> Before caffeine, hydrate.
> Your brain is 75% water.
> Proper hydration is essential for proper brain functioning.
> I wake up and chug 32 oz right away.
> Water before coffee is a good framework to follow.

> 4) Walk + Sunlight
> You want to get into “limbic motion” with a brisk walk for optimal brain functioning and flow state.
> Combine that with staring at the sun for 5-10 minutes to set your circadian rhythm, and you’re primed for a productive, energized day.

> 5) 8 Hours of Sleep
> Your morning productivity starts the night before.
> I used to think I had to get up at 5:30 to “get ahead.”
> BS.
> I’ve recently moved my wake-up time to 730 or 8, and my productivity has doubled.
> Your depth of focus is determined by your depth of sleep.

> 6) Consistent Sleep Schedule
> The amount you sleep is important.
> But more important is the timing.
> A consistent sleep-wake pattern is crucial for energy levels and circadian rhythm regulation.
> For me, I sleep around 11-11:30 pm to 7:30-8 am ~ 90% of nights.

> 7) Fasting
> I’m a big proponent of fasted work for the following reasons:
> • Enhanced focus and energy
> • Triggers the sympathetic nervous system
> • Mimics “hunting” during the day and “feasting” at night
> Eating right away throws my energy off.
> Black coffee and water only.

> 8) Outline 3-5 Tasks
> Before you go to bed, WRITE DOWN what you need to do when you wake up.
> Taking 5 minutes to do this at night will save you hours in the morning.
> You want to wake up with CLARITY and FOCUS.
> Not anxiety and confusion.

> 9) Airplane Mode
> This is the most crucial point.
> Before you go to bed, turn your phone on to airplane mode.
> Don’t turn it off until you finish the 3-5 tasks.
> Resist the urge to check notifications.
> They aren’t important.
> Moving the needle the first 3 hours of the day is.

> 10) Check Notifications as a Reward
> Use your notifications as a reward for finishing your deep work.
> I have a thread going out 5-6 days a week, so my reward is seeing how it’s performing AFTER I finish my needle-moving tasks for the day.
> You want to avoid opening loops.

> If you wake up and instantly check notifications, you might:
> • Be worrying if a girl texted you back
> • Be sucked into a social media rabbit hole 
> • Be wondering who won the Lakers game last night
> Delay the gratification.
> Stay focused.
