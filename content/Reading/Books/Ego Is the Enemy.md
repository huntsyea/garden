> He is a bold surgeon, they say, whose hand does not tremble when he performs an operation upon his own person; and he is often equally bold who does not hesitate to pull off the mysterious veil of self-delusion, which covers from his view the deformities of his own conduct.
> —ADAM SMITH

> Be affable in your relations with those who approach you, and never haughty; for the pride of the arrogant even slaves can hardly endure

> Sherman is that despite his connected father, almost no one would have predicted much more than regional accomplishments—least of all that he would one day need to take the unprecedented step of *refusing the presidency of the United States*
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnh8sm0bywfqs7b4e4m3ghz))

> On several occasions, Sherman freely strategized and planned with the president, but at the end of his trip, he made one strange request; he’d accept his new promotion only with the assurance that he’d *not* have to assume superior command

> He felt he had an honest appreciation for his own abilities and that this role best suited him

> an ambitious person turning down a chance to advance in responsibilities because he actually wanted to be ready for them

> after this brief stumble—having learned from it—that Sherman truly made his mark
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhdqdnkevewy8dd0hg5s0t))

> Building on his successes, Sherman began to advocate for his famous march to the sea—a strategically bold and audacious plan, not born out of some creative genius but rather relying on the exact topography he had scouted and studied as a young officer

> Where Sherman had once been cautious, he was now confident

> he *earned* this opinion

> Any student of military history can see how the exact same invasion, driven by ego instead of a strong sense of purpose, would have had a far different ending
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhj34aastay10kgmcbq45a))

> His entire theory of maneuver warfare rested on deliberately avoiding frontal assaults or shows of strength in the form of pitched battles, and ignoring criticism designed to bait a reaction.

> Among men who rise to fame and leadership two types are recognizable—those who are born with a belief in themselves and those in whom it is a slow growth dependent on actual achievement. To the men of the last type their own success is a constant surprise, and its fruits the more delicious, yet to be tested cautiously with a haunting sense of doubt whether it is not all a dream
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhnrs183gbw9k66rzjahgp))

> if your belief in yourself is *not* dependent on actual achievement, then what is it dependent on?
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhpd5jjdw3517raazs6nqv))

> Where Isocrates and Shakespeare wished us to be self-contained, self-motivated, and ruled by principle, most of us have been trained to do the opposite. Our cultural values almost try to make us dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhr0phctv0fgymy0k5w921))

> In reality, this makes us weak. Yes, you, with all your talent and promise as a boy wonder or a girl-who’s-going-places.
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhs5rc5vnzewmatscq9060))

> As Irving Berlin put it, “Talent is only the starting point.” The question is: Will you be able to make the most of it? Or will you be your own worst enemy? Will you snuff out the flame that is just getting going?

> One might say that the ability to evaluate one’s own ability is the most important skill of all. Without it, improvement is impossible.

> Arrogance and self-absorption inhibit growth. So does fantasy and “vision.”
\-  ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gnnhvw8sv5e750n3e18kxcym))

> Detachment is a sort of natural ego antidote. It’s *easy* to be emotionally invested and infatuated with your own work. Any and every narcissist can do that

> For your work to have truth in it, it must come from truth

> We will learn that though we *think* big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek

> We will learn that though we *think* big, we must act and live small in order to accomplish what we seek. Because we will be *action* and *education* focused, and forgo validation and status, our ambition will not be grandiose but iterative—one foot in front of the other, learning and growing and putting in the time.

> Although we share with many others a *vision* for greatness, we understand that our *path* toward it is very different from theirs. Following Sherman and Isocrates, we understand that ego is our enemy on that journey
