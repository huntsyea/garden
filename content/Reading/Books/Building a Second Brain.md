> Over the course of her career, Swift has released five documentary films revealing her creative songwriting process. In all of them, she can be found with her head buried in her phone. As she says: “I disappear into my phone because my phone is where I keep my notes and my phone is where I’m editing.”[2](Building%2520a%2520Second%2520Brain.md##ch04fn2) In her notes she can write down (and reread, edit, and riff off) any snippet of lyrics or melodic hook that flickers through her mind. She can take her notes everywhere, access them from anywhere, and send them within seconds to a wide network of producers and collaborators using the same device. Any feedback they send back can go right into her notes as well.

> Actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld, arguably the most influential comedian of his generation, wrote in his book *Is This Anything?*:
> > *Whenever I came up with a funny bit, whether it happened on a stage, in a conversation or working it out on my preferred canvas, the big yellow legal pad, I kept it in one of those old-school accordion folders… A lot of people I’ve talked to seemed surprised that I’ve kept all these notes. I don’t understand why they think that. I don’t understand why I’ve kept anything else. What could possibly be of more value?*

> Knowledge isn’t just wise quotations from long-dead Greek philosophers in white togas. It’s not just the teachings found within thick textbooks written by academics with advanced degrees. In the digital world we live in, knowledge most often shows up as “content”—snippets of text, screenshots, bookmarked articles, podcasts, or other kinds of media. This includes the content you gather from outside sources but also the content you create as you compose emails, draw up project plans, brainstorm ideas, and journal your own thoughts.

> Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts. External knowledge could include:
> • **Highlights:** Insightful passages from books or articles you read.
> • **Quotes:** Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.
> • **Bookmarks and favorites:** Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts.
> • **Voice memos:** Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”
> • **Meeting notes:** Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.
> • **Images:** Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.
> • **Takeaways:** Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.

> As you start collecting this material from the outer world, it often sparks new ideas and realizations in your inner world. You can capture those thoughts too! They could include:
> • **Stories:** Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.
> • **Insights:** The small (and big) realizations you have.
> • **Memories:** Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget.
> • **Reflections:** Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary.
> • **Musings:** Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.

> I call it “Twelve Favorite Problems,” inspired by Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman.

> Of course, Feynman is best known for his groundbreaking discoveries in theoretical physics and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1965.

> You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!

> As told in *Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman* by James Gleick,[5](Building%2520a%2520Second%2520Brain.md##ch04fn5) Feynman once took inspiration for his physics from an accident at dinner:
> > *… he was eating in the student cafeteria when someone tossed a dinner plate into the air—a Cornell cafeteria plate with the* *university seal imprinted on one rim—and in the instant of its flight he experienced what he long afterward considered an epiphany. As the plate spun, it wobbled. Because of the insignia he could see that the spin and the wobble were not quite in synchrony. Yet just in that instant it seemed to him—or was it his physicist’s intuition?—that the two rotations were related.*
> After working the problem out on paper, Feynman discovered a 2-to-1 ratio between the plate’s wobble and spin, a neat relationship that suggested a deeper underlying principle at work.
> When a fellow physicist and mentor asked what the use of such an insight was, Feynman responded: “It doesn’t have any importance… I don’t care whether a thing has importance. Isn’t it fun?” He was following his intuition and curiosity. But it did end up having importance, with his research into the equations underlying rotation informing the work that ultimately led to him receiving the Nobel Prize.

> The biggest pitfall I see people falling into once they begin capturing digital notes is saving too much. If you try to save every piece of material you come across, you run the risk of inundating your future self with tons of irrelevant information

> This is why it’s so important to take on a Curator’s Perspective—that we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. Thinking like a curator means taking charge of your own information stream, instead of just letting it wash over you

> There is a way to evoke a sense of inspiration more regularly: keep a collection of inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories. Any time you need a break, a new perspective, or a dash of motivation, you can look through it and see what sparks your imagination.

> That isn’t what a Second Brain is for. The renowned information theorist Claude Shannon, whose discoveries paved the way for modern technology, had a simple definition for “information”: that which surprises you.[7](Building%2520a%2520Second%2520Brain.md##ch04fn7)
