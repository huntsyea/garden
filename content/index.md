Hi Scott
# What is this?
This is a live repository of my notes, often called a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). This is the space all of learning, ideas, and reading notes get dumped. There is rarely any level of polish, so keep that in mind when browsing. 
# Why a digital garden?
I believe in building in public **and** learning in public. While messy and disorganized thoughts and ideas get better with discussion.
