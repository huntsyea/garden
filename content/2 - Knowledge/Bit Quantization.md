Title: Bit Quantization
---


Bit quantization is a process used in data compression and digital signal processing to reduce the number of bits required to represent data without significantly losing its original quality.

In simple terms, when we capture or generate digital data (like an image or sound), each pixel or sample is represented by a certain number of bits. For example, an 8-bit image means that each pixel is represented by 8 bits, allowing for 256 possible values (from 0 to 255).

However, not all data requires the full range of values available with a higher bit depth. Bit quantization involves assigning fewer bits to represent data while trying to minimize the loss of information. This is done by rounding off the values to the nearest representable value using the available bits. For instance, if we reduce an 8-bit image to 4 bits, each pixel will now only have 16 possible values instead of 256.

The goal is to find a good balance between reducing the storage requirements and acceptable loss in quality. Over-quantization can lead to noticeable degradation of data, while under-quantization might not provide significant storage savings.
