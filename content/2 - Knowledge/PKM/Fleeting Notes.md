Title: Fleeting Notes
---
Fleeting Notes are intended for quick, temporary capture of information. These notes are typically short and unstructured, serving as placeholders for thoughts, ideas, or observations that you encounter throughout the day. They are not meant to be kept indefinitely and should be processed regularly, either by discarding them or transforming them into more permanent forms.
