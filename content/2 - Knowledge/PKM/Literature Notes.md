Title: Literature Notes
---
Literature Notes are created while engaging with reading materials such as books, articles, or research papers. These notes capture key insights, summaries, and reflections from the text. The goal is to distill the essential information and your thoughts on it, making it easier to refer back to and integrate into your broader knowledge base. Literature Notes should be concise yet comprehensive enough to convey the main points and your understanding of the material.
