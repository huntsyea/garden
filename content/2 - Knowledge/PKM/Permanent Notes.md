Permanent Notes are the cornerstone of a robust knowledge management system. They represent well-formed, lasting pieces of information that you have processed and understood. Each Permanent Note should contain a single idea or concept, written in your own words to ensure comprehension. These notes are interconnected through links to related notes, creating a web of knowledge that grows over time. Permanent Notes are designed to be revisited and built upon, serving as the foundation for deeper insights and new connections.
