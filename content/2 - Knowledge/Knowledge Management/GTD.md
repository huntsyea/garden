The **GTD** methodology is designed to help individuals increase productivity and reduce stress by organizing tasks and projects in a systematic way. It is built around five core components:

1. **Capture** - Collect everything that requires your attention. This includes tasks, ideas, appointments, and any other commitments. The goal is to get everything out of your head and into a trusted system, such as a digital note, a physical inbox, or a dedicated app.

2. **Clarify** - Process the items you have captured to determine what they mean and what action, if any, is required. Ask yourself whether each item is actionable. If it is, decide what the next action is. If not, you can either discard it, incubate it for later, or archive it for reference.

3. **Organize** - Place items where they belong within your system. This involves categorizing tasks and projects, setting due dates, and organizing information in a way that makes it easy to access and review. Common categories include "Next Actions," "Projects," "Waiting For," and "Someday/Maybe."

4. **Reflect** - Regularly review your system to ensure it remains current and effective. This includes a weekly review where you go through your lists, update your projects, and ensure that everything is captured and organized. Reflecting helps you stay on top of your commitments and make informed decisions about what to focus on next.

5. **Engage** - Take action based on your current context, available time, and energy levels. Use your organized lists to decide what to work on next, ensuring that you are always moving forward on your most important tasks and projects.

By following these steps, the GTD methodology helps create a clear and actionable plan for managing tasks and projects, reducing overwhelm and increasing productivity.
