> A few people DM-ing how I'd think about what type of membership to create
> 1) I'd use [https://t.co/MF6EmELqSn](https://t.co/MF6EmELqSn) to find interesting niches
> 2) I'd prioritize by "willingness to pay". Some niches are underserved but unwilling to pay
> 3) I'd try to come up with a catchy name. I'd brainstorm with a clever friend/colleague or use ChatGPT has a sparring partner
> 4) I'd start by building an audience first. One platform, one format of post. I'd use Canva or create AI videos with something like Sythensia or Deepbrain
> 5) I'd convert some of the audience to a free community, just to get their emails and begin earning trust
> 6) I'd probably use Skool,Whatsapp or FB groups to do that ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm51688689awfe80sk055jfj))
