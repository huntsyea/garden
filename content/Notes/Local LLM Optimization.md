To achieve good performance with large language models (LLMs) on your Mac with an 8GB RAM, you'll want to focus on models and configurations that are efficient in terms of memory usage and computational requirements.

Firstly, consider using models that have been specifically optimized for lower memory footprints. For instance, some LLMs like Google's T5-Small or Microsoft's DistilBERT have been designed to be smaller and more memory-efficient than their larger counterparts. These models may not provide the same level of performance as more resource-intensive models but are better suited for systems with limited RAM.

Secondly, regarding [[./LLM Bit Quantization|LLM Bit Quantization]] type and options, consider using 16-bit or even 8-bit floating-point representations instead of the default 32-bit floats. This reduction in bit depth can significantly decrease memory usage without causing significant degradation in model performance. Many deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch support quantization during inference.

Another option to consider is using quantized models, which store weights with lower precision than the default 32-bit floats. This can lead to substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational requirements. For example, Google's Slimmable Neural Networks (Slimmable-NN) allow you to adjust the model depth on the fly, enabling efficient inference with lower precision weights.

However, keep in mind that using quantized models or lower-precision representations may result in slightly reduced model performance compared to their full-precision counterparts. It's essential to find a balance between the desired level of accuracy and resource utilization based on your specific use case.
